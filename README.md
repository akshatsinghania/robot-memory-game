# Robot Memory Game

Welcome to the Robot Memory Game! This project is an interactive memory game created using a HamsterS robot and Python's `tkinter` library. The game challenges your memory skills by presenting a sequence of colored lights, which you must then replicate using the robot's front LED.

## Overview

The Robot Memory Game is designed to test and improve your memory. The HamsterS robot will display a sequence of colors using its front LED, and your goal is to repeat the sequence correctly. The game gets progressively harder as the sequence length increases with each level. Track your progress with the built-in high score system!

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Use the robot's front LED and buttons to interact with the game.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: Each level adds a new color to the sequence.
- **High Score Tracking**: Your highest level achieved is saved between sessions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface built with `tkinter`.

## Installation

### Requirements

- **Hamster S Robot**
  - I got my hamster S robot from my school's Computer Science Club, I believe its quite commonly available in schools so could try to get it from there
- **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
- **HamsterS Python Library** to control the HamsterS robot, the libary is included in the github repo itself, but incase there are any latest features, you can install the library using pip3
- **Tkinter** for the GUI (usually comes pre-installed with Python).

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshatsinghania/robot-memory-game.git
cd robot-memory-game
```

### Usage

```bash
python3 memory.py
```

That's it!!

Now you should see a screen with the memory game and an option to start
